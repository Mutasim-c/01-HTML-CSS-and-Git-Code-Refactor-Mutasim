# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## challenge

my challenge was to use the html and css file i recieved, and change up the code, not to change how the file looked when it ran, but to clean it up.

For example I needed to use semantic html, for accessibility, so any user could read my html file and easly follow what each section does, before alot of divs were used but the chages were so i could tell the difference between an aside and a footer.

Another thing i did was to comment the css file so any user could understand what the different classes do.I also added alt attributes to img, gave the title a title that made more sense for the page andmade sure the headers fall in sequential order.
